# Porting ledger

## Objective

Create public Heapy/kotdoc, port all of Pandoc to Kotlin including all tests, then
port calibre MOBI support and its tests and the other formats absent from Pandoc.
This objective is not satisfied by wrapping upstream binaries, implementing only
an ebook subset, storing untranslated tests, or passing the currently ported tests.

## Baseline

The three `upstream/` Git submodules pin exact source revisions and include their
original test trees. Pandoc 3.12.1's cabal constraint accepts pandoc-types 1.23.1.2.
Kotlin code is built with Kotlin 2.4.21, Gradle 9.8.1, JDK 21, and
kotlinx.serialization-json 1.11.0. JSON syntax uses that library; Pandoc's wire
format is implemented explicitly in Kotlin.

## Completed slices

| Source | Kotlin | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| pandoc-types `Text/Pandoc/Definition.hs` AST constructors | `core/.../ast/Pandoc.kt` | All node variants represented; JSON tests |
| Definition JSON instances | `core/.../ast/PandocJson.kt` | 56 upstream fixtures × encoding/decoding checks |
| `test/test-pandoc-types.hs` literal JSON examples | `UpstreamJsonTest.kt` | Independent typed expected values, exact JSON bytes |
| `prop_roundtrip` | `PandocJsonTest.kt` | 500 seeded recursive documents (not identical to upstream QuickCheck generator) |
| `Builder.hs` table normalization and simpleTable | `Tables.kt` | Both original examples, nine upstream properties with 500 samples each, independent occupancy oracle |
| `Walk.hs` traversal order and child selection | `PandocVisitor.kt` | Node transforms/queries checked against independent generic JSON traversal over upstream fixtures; list hooks and ordering checks |

Fixture import is reproducible with `tools/import-pandoc-json-fixtures.py` and
checked against the pinned original by CI. A fixture is not considered covered
merely because decode/encode returns the same input: the decoded typed model is
also compared with an independently translated upstream expectation.

## Remaining scope

1. Finish pandoc-types semantics and tests: full walker/list property generators,
   builders, inline normalization, figures, metadata operations, full generators.
   Preserve Haskell Format case-fold equality and machine-Int semantics; current
   raw format fields use String and numeric fields use JVM Int. These are known
   parity gaps, not deliberate simplifications of the final objective.
2. Port Pandoc common infrastructure: options and extensions, parsing, sources,
   URI/XML handling, media bag, templates, resource embedding, errors, logging,
   Unicode, syntax highlighting, bibliography/citations, filters and scripting.
3. Port every Pandoc reader and writer and its Haskell, command, golden,
   Lua/filter, and integration tests. Preserve options and default behavior.
4. Port the full CLI/application behavior and test it against the pinned upstream
   binary. The current CLI is only a JSON entry point, not CLI parity.
5. Port calibre ebook infrastructure and MOBI reader/writer paths (MOBI6/KF8,
   containers, compression, metadata, navigation, images), with original tests
   and actual old-Kindle compatibility checks.
6. Enumerate and port calibre's additional input/output formats absent from
   Pandoc from its conversion registry, including their supporting algorithms
   and test suites. Do not assume the formats are limited to MOBI/AZW3.
7. Complete the test inventory and map every upstream test to Kotlin evidence,
   including tests embedded in source modules. Files retained in submodules do
   not constitute test ports. Track behavioral deviations explicitly and resolve
   them before claiming parity.
8. Validate cross-format conversion, CLI error behavior, corrupted inputs,
   Unicode, large documents, determinism, resource use, and release packaging.

## Next execution step

Finish `Text.Pandoc.Builder` and Definition operations (including Format and
numeric parity), port the remaining Walk list properties and Figure property,
then start Pandoc readers/writers against the shared model. The visitor currently
has 10 tests over upstream fixtures and targeted cases; this is not the complete
QuickCheck domain from upstream. Use differential checks against upstream as well
as original golden expectations.

Current verification: 142 Kotlin tests pass locally; the initial 118-test commit
also passed GitHub Linux CI. Every push runs the fixture check, Kotlin tests and
installed CLI smoke checks in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Completion gate

Completion requires evidence for the complete objective above, all mapped tests,
and resolution of behavioral gaps. A green Kotlin CI run only proves the slices
it actually exercises. Neither all tests being present as Haskell/Python nor all
current Kotlin tests passing establishes completion.
